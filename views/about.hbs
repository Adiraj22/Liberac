              <p>“My parents immigrated from Samoa in the ’60s. Although they’ve spent most of their lives in New Zealand, they occasionally send money back to Samoa. My dad’s in his eighties, and he still physically sends money back using cash via an MTO. I want to make that process for him much easier using a digital platform.”</p>

              <p>“I was born in India, and came to New Zealand as a 9 year old. When my parents needed money to buy a house they had to borrow from family overseas - which cost them a lot in fees. International money transfers provides a tangible way for people to help their family and friends in a time of need. Sending money overseas should be something that’s easy, and cheap to do.”</p>
